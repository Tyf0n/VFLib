****************************************************************
VFLib code can be used to find/perform Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) 
or Substructure searches based on Graph (Sub)-Isomorphism.
****************************************************************

The algorithm is described in 
Cordella, L.P.; Foggia, P.; Sansone, C.; Vento, M. 
"A (sub)graph isomorphism algorithm for matching large graphs"
Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on
Volume 26, Issue 10, Oct. 2004 Page(s):1367 - 1372

The original code was taken from http://metamolecular.com/mx and modified by
Syed Asad Rahman (asad@ebi.ac.uk)

This code requires the Chemistry Development Kit 
(CDK http://cdk.git.sourceforge.net) .

The present code is part of the Small Molecule Subgraph Detector 
(SMSD http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/SMSD/) library.

If you use this software please cite the paper and the URL (SMSD)

Wish you a happy coding!
